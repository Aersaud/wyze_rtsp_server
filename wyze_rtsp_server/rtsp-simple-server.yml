# RTSP parameters

# Disable support for the RTSP protocol.
rtspDisable: no
# List of enabled RTSP transport protocols.
# UDP is the most performant, but doesn't work when there's a NAT/firewall between
# server and clients, and doesn't support encryption.
# UDP-multicast allows to save bandwidth when clients are all in the same LAN.
# TCP is the most versatile, and does support encryption.
# The handshake is always performed with TCP.
protocols: [multicast, tcp]
# Encrypt handshakes and TCP streams with TLS (RTSPS).
# Available values are "no", "strict", "optional".
encryption: "no"
# Address of the TCP/RTSP listener. This is needed only when encryption is "no" or "optional".
rtspAddress: :8554
# Address of the TCP/TLS/RTSPS listener. This is needed only when encryption is "strict" or "optional".
#rtspsAddress: :8322
# Address of the UDP/RTP listener. This is needed only when "udp" is in protocols.
#rtpAddress: :8000
# Address of the UDP/RTCP listener. This is needed only when "udp" is in protocols.
#rtcpAddress: :8001
# IP range of all UDP-multicast listeners. This is needed only when "multicast" is in protocols.
multicastIPRange: 224.1.0.0/16
# Port of all UDP-multicast/RTP listeners. This is needed only when "multicast" is in protocols.
multicastRTPPort: 8002
# Port of all UDP-multicast/RTCP listeners. This is needed only when "multicast" is in protocols.
multicastRTCPPort: 8003
# Path to the server key. This is needed only when encryption is "strict" or "optional".
# This can be generated with:
# openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
# openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 3650
#serverKey: server.key
# Path to the server certificate. This is needed only when encryption is "strict" or "optional".
